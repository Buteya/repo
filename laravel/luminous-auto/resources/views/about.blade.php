    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">About Us</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: left; color: darkblue;">Who We Are</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Luminous Auto is an online platform that connects car buyers and sellers in a fast, easy, and transparent way.

  <h2 style="text-align: left; color: darkblue;">Our Story</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Luminous Auto was founded in 2023 by Steve and Masira, two friends who shared a love for cars and a vision for a better way to buy and sell them online. They noticed that the traditional car market was full of inefficiencies, hassles, and risks, and that there was a lack of trust and transparency between buyers and sellers. They decided to create a platform that would solve these problems and offer a superior car shopping experience.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: left; color: darkblue;">Our Mission</h2>
